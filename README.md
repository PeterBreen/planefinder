This app is archived. I sketched it out as an experiment using Next, but then my time was taken up with work! Maybe someday.



# Planefinder

App to assist in identifying non-bird, non-Superman flying objects, built with Next.


Specifically, this app will ask the user a series of questions to determine which model plane they're looking at - things like 'how many engines does it have' and 'where are they' and 'is the nose pointy' (yeah, that's actually a thing) and return an answer based on the best known match to the criteria they select.
